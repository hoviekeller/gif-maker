GIF Maker is an extension that enables you to create GIF files easily inside your browser.

As the source for the GIF file, this app needs some images or a video file. Once one of these inputs is provided, you can click on the - Make GIF - button to create the GIF file. Please note that, before making the GIF image, there are several settings that you can adjust. If you want to save the GIF file to your machine, please click on the - Download - button. The file will be saved to the default download location on your machine.

On the top right corner of the UI, there is a reload button to reload the app (in case something goes wrong or an error occurs). Please note that the default size for the GIF image is (300 x 300) pixels, however, you can edit this value from the UI. This app uses an opensource JavaScript library called gifshot (https://github.com/yahoo/gifshot/blob/master/dist/gifshot.js).
